    excerpt: "A recap of our 2-day intensive workshop on Python and Data Science libraries.",
    content: `
      <p>On September 11th and 12th, the AI & ML Club hosted a transformative workshop on Data Science Programming Logic (DSPL). Over two days, students dove deep into Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization techniques</strong> - Learned to create compelling visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
        <li><strong>Real-world dataset handling</strong> - Worked with actual datasets from Kaggle and practiced data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
        <li><strong>Pandas Operations</strong> - Mastered DataFrame manipulation, grouping, and aggregation</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong> - Applied statistical methods to derive insights from data</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The workshop was highly interactive with hands-on coding sessions. Participants worked on mini-projects analyzing real datasets and presenting their findings.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        "This workshop gave me the confidence to start working on data science projects independently. The practical approach was incredibly helpful!" - Workshop Participant
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>We received overwhelming positive feedback and plan to conduct more such intensive workshops in the future. Special thanks to all the mentors and participants who made this event a success!</p>

    excerpt: "How students battled it out in our flagship aptitude competition this October.",
    content: `
      <p>The energy was high on October 13th as we launched <strong>APTIFY</strong> - our flagship aptitude test designed to challenge students' logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities.</p>
      
      <h3>Event Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 150 participants from various branches</li>
        <li>60-minute intense test covering multiple domains</li>
        <li>Number theory and mathematical reasoning</li>
        <li>Logical puzzles and pattern recognition</li>
        <li>Quantitative analysis</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What Made APTIFY Special:</h3>
      <p>Unlike traditional aptitude tests, APTIFY focused on practical problem-solving skills that are essential in the tech industry. The questions were carefully curated to test analytical thinking rather than rote learning.</p>
      
      <h3>Top Performers:</h3>
      <p>Congratulations to all participants who proved their mettle! The top 10 performers received certificates and recognition from the club. Many participants expressed that the test helped them identify areas for improvement.</p>
      
      <p>We plan to make APTIFY an annual event and expand it to include programming challenges in the next edition.</p>
      
      <p><em>Stay tuned for APTIFY 2.0!</em></p>
